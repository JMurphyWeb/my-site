      <h3>A quick update</h3></h3>
      <p id="date">20 August 2015</p>

      <p>Tonight I have been looking into some GitHub basics.  As can be seen from the URL, I am hosting this site through GitHub's gh-pages.  The basic steps have been to create a new branch called "gh-pages", then to add, commit and push files from my computer into the new branch.  Now I am exploring how to commit directly from the master branch, rather than from my local directory every time.  Wish me luck....</p>

      <h3>Finally a post!</h3></h3>
      <p id="date">15 August 2015</p>

      <p>Website is up and ready, far from perfect but I will look to iron out any problems in the coming weeks.  I think I will post the site on Reddit’s r/learn-web-dev forum which I hope will provide some useful feedback.  </p>
      
      <p>

So, the website is more or less ok, which means I cannot put off what is my first ever blog post, any longer.  It’s probably been lurking somewhere at the bottom of several to-do lists for a few months now, along with making granola bars.  Making to-do lists is one of my main strengths, I like to wait until my caffeine high kicks into bionic stage, before whipping out my chosen ink and parchment and devising a ridiculously unachievable list.  I never learn, but I stand by them.
</p>
<p>
Time is running out for me as I am catching a bus up into northern Vietnam this evening, I wanted to write about the making of this site, but I guess I’ll have to stick it on the next to do list.  Keep an eye out for my photo a day.</p>
